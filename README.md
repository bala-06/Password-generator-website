# Password-generator-website
This project is to create a password generator web application that generates random passwords based on user preferences. 
Users can customize the password length and select whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
The generated passwords aim to improve security by providing a diverse mix of characters.
The password generator application follows a systematic methodology to generate random passwords. 
The user provides input through the web interface, specifying the desired length of the password and the inclusion of different character types. 
The application validates the user input and ensures that the total count of characters does not exceed the specified password length. 
The password generation process involves randomly selecting characters from the defined character sets and concatenating them according to the user's preferences. 
Finally, the generated password undergoes a shuffling algorithm to enhance its randomness and security.
